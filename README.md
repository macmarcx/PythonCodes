# üêç Python Portfolio

Welcome to my Python Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of my Python projects, scripts, and utilities. Whether you're a fellow developer, a potential employer, or just curious, feel free to explore the code and get a glimpse of what I‚Äôve been working on.

## üöÄ Projects

### 1. **Data Manipulation Script for Analyzing Employee Salaries by Department**
Overview: This script processes employee data, specifically focusing on cleaning and analyzing salary information. It reads data from a CSV file, cleans the salary column by removing currency symbols, converts the data to a numerical format, and calculates the average salary per department. The results are visualized using a bar chart to highlight salary distribution across departments.
- **Key Concepts**: Data Cleaning, Aggregation, Grouping, Data Visualization
- **Languages**: Python

### 2. **Web Scraper**
An efficient web scraper that extracts data from websites and saves it in a structured format for analysis.
- **Key Concepts**: Web scraping, Data handling
- **Libraries Used**: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`

### 3. **Data Visualizer**
A project focused on visualizing data using Python. Includes bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots to present data insights.
- **Key Concepts**: Data Visualization, Data Analysis
- **Libraries Used**: `matplotlib`, `pandas`

### 4. **REST API Client**
A simple client to interact with RESTful APIs, handle responses, and manage errors efficiently.
- **Key Concepts**: API Interaction, Error Handling
- **Libraries Used**: `requests`
